1. This is the dev branch. We will merge the test brances ( 1. api-testing, 2. jest-unit-test, 3. web-driver-io-test)
    and feature branches with this branch.

2. This branch has protected rules. Everytime there will be any push or pull request from other branch, the reviewer must look the change and accept or deny it.

3. There is also github action workflow for this branch, so it will run all the tests after push or pull request.
